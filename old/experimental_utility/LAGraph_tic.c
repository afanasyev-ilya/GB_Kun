// LAGraph_tic:  a portable timer for accurate performance measurements.
// Contributed by Tim Davis, Texas A&M

// There is no method that works on all operating systems for finding the
// current time with high resolution that is suitable for performance
// measurements.  The LAGraph_tic and LAGraph_toc functions provide a portable
// alternative.

// LAGraph_tic (tic) ; gets the current time and saves it in tic [0..1].

// t = LAGraph_toc (tic) ; returns the time in seconds since the last call to
// LAGraph_toc, as a single double value.

// Example:

/*
    double tic [2], t ;
    LAGraph_tic (tic) ;
    // ... do stuff
    t = LAGraph_toc (tic) ;
    printf ("time to 'do stuff' : %g (seconds)\n', t) ;
    // ... more stuff
    t = LAGraph_toc (tic) ;
    printf ("time to 'do stuff' and 'more stuff': %g (seconds)\n', t) ;
*/
