// LAGraph_rand: return a random number, contributed by Tim Davis, Texas A&M.
// Modified from the POSIX-1.2001 example of rand.

// A simple thread-safe random number generator that returns a random number
// between 0 and LAGRAPH_RAND_MAX.  The quality of the random values it
// generates is very low, but this is not important.  This method is used to
// create random test matrices, which must be identical on any operating
// system.
